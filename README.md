# startnow-react200-movie-finder

This is my "Movie Finder" project that allows you to search for movies and look up details about that movie. 
This project was completed using React, Redux, and Axios.

After downloading the project, run:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
